# Laravue

This is a Laravel template I use for my own projects.

## How is it different from a clean Laravel installation ?

The most important change is that it removes all of Laravel Mix configuration and adds new webpack config files. I tried using Laravel Mix for some projects but it just didsn't feel right. I didn't like how everything was configured, it took way too long to compile sometimes and I just felt like I had no control.

I took the new configuration files from the [vue-webpack template](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and integrated them with Laravel. The workflow feels very nice and fast now.

Another change is that Laravel comes with bootstrap to handle some styles, for example inside the views generated by the Auth command. Instead I'm using [Bulma](http://bulma.io) because it's more modern, it's completely independant from jQuery or Javascript in general, and you can easily integrate its components with Vue for example.

Laravel also adds some useful stuff to a global Javascript variable called Laravel. I added some more stuff to it like the Laravel error bag and the old inputs. There is an `utils` folder wehre I created a file called `laravel` than just pulls in the global variable and exports it. Then in my Vue components I can import it to make calls to that variable a litlle bit cleaner.

If a view has an specific requirement for a php variable or something that it could get from Laravel, I have created some little `blade` files that I put in the `resources/views/injectors` folder that serve that purpose. They just add a script that attaches the new value to the Laravel global variable. You can then include this injector in the view that should use it. You can check some examples in the views that come by default or in the views generated by the Auth command.

These are the things I can contrast with a regular Laravel installation, but there are some others added on top of them. At the end everything is really opinionated but maybe you can give it a try!

## How can I start a project using this ?

It's really easy to get up and running. Just follow these steps:

1. Start a project by running `composer create-project --prefer-dist prwlr/laravue project-name`.
2. Go into your project directory and run `yarn` or `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. In your `.env` file there is a line that reads `APP_DEV_URL=http://localhost`. Change that variable to whatever your application url is. This is important for development since paths to assets will be constructed using this url. For example for the homestead default url it would look like `APP_DEV_URL=http://homestead.app`.
4. Now you may run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to start working on your project.

The command will try to open a browser automatically pointing to your project's url. Sometimes it won't be able to, for example when running with vagrant, so just open it manually.

You can also use the `php artisan make:auth` command which I modified to generate the same pages you would expect, but showcasing some Vue components instead.

## About the Libraries

I'll try to list everything that has been included in the template.

- Vue components can be written either using JSX syntax or using `.vue` files. I prefer the JSX syntax since I feel I have more control. Also feels more natural since I've been writing React for quite a while.
- SCSS is used to handle the base styles, variables, mixins and importing and overriding vendors.
- Each Vue Component imports an `.scssm` file to handle its own styles. This file extension was defined by me to tell webpack to process this file with SCSS and CSS Modules. It's a nice combo since you have scoped selectors, and can also make use of your variables and mixins importing them from your sass folder.
- Bulma has been imported in the SCSS files. You can remove it or just pull in the components you need since it's very modular. The views generated by the Auth command are using it though so just keep that in mind. There is also an example on how to override its variables.
- Normalize.css is imported before any other css to handle some resets.
- Animate.css was also included in the project. With this it's simple to add animations to some Bulma components.

## What tasks can I use ?

I'll just copy most of the descriptions from the [Vuejs Webpack template](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack) since this is the template I merged with Laravel. If you want to know anything else about the tasks, about the folder structure or how to change or extend anything refer to their [docs](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/).

- `yarn dev || npm run dev`: First-in-class development experience.
  - Start developing by going into your browser and hitting your `APP_URL` (It will try to open it automatically).
  - Vue preset to handle vue files written with JSX. This is the syntax I prefer since it's more powerful although a little bit more verbose.
  - Webpack + `vue-loader` for single file Vue components is also available.
  - Hot-reloading (It can't preserve the state though).
  - State preserving compilation error overlay.
  - Lint-on-save with ESLint.
  - Source maps.

- `yarn build || npm run build`: Production ready build.
  - JavaScript minified with [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2).
  - HTML minified with [html-minifier](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier).
  - CSS across all components extracted into a single file and minified with [cssnano](https://github.com/ben-eb/cssnano).
  - All static assets compiled with version hashes for efficient long-term caching, and a production `base.blade.php` is auto-generated with proper URLs to these generated assets.

There is a command for testing which is `yarn test || npm run test`, but it doesn't work for now. Still not sure how to handle testing for Vue Components using the JSX syntax. You can consider it WIP.

## So, anything else ?

Not really. I'd just want to thank you for giving it a try or at least reading through. If you have any feedback it'd be greatly appreciated. I bet a lot of things could be improved and I'm open to discussion, so open an issue, send a pull request or message me to gianluca.prwlr@gmail.com.
